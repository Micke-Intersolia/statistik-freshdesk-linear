## What this project is

A Bronze → Silver → Gold data pipeline for Power BI reporting at Intersolia.
- **Sources:** Freshdesk (support tickets) + Linear (product issues)
- **Pipeline:** GitHub Actions → raw JSON → SQL Server → Power BI
- **Database:** `InternalStatistics` on `INTSQLSERVER01` (SQL Server 2022)
- **Schemas:** `bronze`, `silver`, `gold`
- **Auth:** SQL Server Authentication — connection string in `credentials/sql_connection.txt`
- **Localhost:** `OPEX_statistics` on localhost still exists as dev/test environment

Full architecture in README.md. Full decision history in History.md.

## Current state (update this section when layers change)

| Layer | Freshdesk | Linear |
|---|---|---|
| Bronze tables | ✅ Done | ✅ Done |
| Bronze loader (Python) | ✅ Done | ✅ Done |
| Silver table | ✅ Done | ✅ Done |
| Silver load script | ✅ Done | ✅ Done |
| Gold dim_date | ✅ Done | ✅ Done (shared) |
| Gold fact views | ✅ Done | ✅ Done |
| Power BI | 🔄 In progress | 🔄 In progress |
| Silver refresh automation | ❌ Not started | ❌ Not started |

**Active tracks:**

**Track 1 — Power BI visuals (user has started this)**
- Connect Power BI Desktop → Get Data → SQL Server
- Server: `INTSQLSERVER01`, Database: `InternalStatistics`
- Import `gold.DimDate`, `gold.FactFreshdesk`, `gold.FactLinear`
- Create DATE relationships: DimDate.date_key → FactFreshdesk.created_at and FactLinear.created_at
- Add role-playing date relationships for first_passed_at, first_waiting_at, closed_at

**Track 2 — Automate silver refresh via GitHub Actions (next session)**
- Goal: run `bronze_loader.py` + silver SQL scripts automatically after each nightly snapshot, without triggering from the laptop
- Current gap: the existing workflow only handles API snapshots → JSON → git commit. It does NOT load bronze or rebuild silver.
- Key constraint to investigate: GitHub Actions uses Microsoft-hosted runners (external internet), which likely cannot reach `INTSQLSERVER01` directly. Options to explore:
  - **Self-hosted runner** on a machine inside Intersolia's network that can reach the SQL Server (most likely path)
  - **SQL Server Agent** job on `INTSQLSERVER01` itself, triggered on a schedule (no GitHub dependency)
  - **Hybrid:** GitHub Actions commits the files; a SQL Server Agent job polls for new files and runs bronze_loader + silver scripts on a server that has both network access and Python
- Also needed: `script/silver_loader.py` — Python script (using pyodbc, same pattern as bronze_loader.py) that executes `05_silver_load_freshdesk.sql` and `07_silver_load_linear.sql`. This makes the silver step runnable from anywhere without sqlcmd.

## Architecture decisions (the non-obvious ones)

**Bronze is append-style, not upsert.**
Same ticket/issue ID can appear in multiple rows from different snapshots.
`bronze.import_log` prevents re-loading the same file twice.

**Silver is TRUNCATE + full rebuild.**
Not incremental upsert. This is intentional: `denied_triage` and the date
columns depend on the full bronze history and cannot be computed row-by-row.

**Retention uses filename timestamp, not file mtime.**
GitHub Actions resets all file timestamps on checkout. Both snapshot scripts
parse the date from the filename regex `(\d{8}T\d{6}Z)`.

**ISO 8601 strings in bronze, DATE in silver.**
Bronze stores raw strings (e.g. `"2026-06-04T11:14:51.968Z"`).
Silver converts with `TRY_CAST(LEFT(col, 10) AS DATE)`.
ISO 8601 UTC strings compare correctly as strings (lexicographic = chronological).

**group_id and product_id are BIGINT.**
Freshdesk IDs reach ~14 billion — exceeds INT max (~2.1B).

## Freshdesk silver schema

`silver.freshdesk_tickets` — one row per ticket, latest state.

| Column | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | INT PK | |
| `status` | TINYINT | 17=Waiting triage, 6/7/12=Passed triage, 2/3/4/5=Open/Pending/Resolved/Closed |
| `created_at` | DATE | |
| `updated_at` | DATE | |
| `product_id` | BIGINT | |
| `first_waiting_at` | DATE | First bronze row with status=17 |
| `first_passed_at` | DATE | First bronze row with status IN (6,7,12) |
| `denied_triage` | BIT | Had 6/7/12, then returned to 17 |
| `denied_triage_at` | DATE | Date of that regression |

Excluded from silver: `subject`, `priority`, `due_by`, `group_id`.
Excluded tickets: `group_id` ending in `1939` or `8846`.

---

## Linear silver schema

`silver.linear_issues` — one row per issue, latest state.

| Column | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | NVARCHAR(50) PK | Linear GUID |
| `state_name` | NVARCHAR | Current status text |
| `state_type` | NVARCHAR | unstarted/started/completed/cancelled (backlog≈unstarted, resolve in gold) |
| `priority` | TINYINT | 0=None, 1=Urgent, 2=High, 3=Medium, 4=Low |
| `created_at` | DATE | |
| `started_at` | DATE | When work began |
| `completed_at` | DATE | Linear's own field — completed-type states only |
| `closed_at` | DATE | COALESCE(completed_at, canceled_at) — all done states |
| `project_name` | NVARCHAR | |
| `assignee_name` | NVARCHAR | |
| `labels` | NVARCHAR | Pipe-separated |
| `trashed` | BIT | |
| `is_incident` | BIT | labels LIKE '%incident%' (CI collation = case-insensitive) |

Filter: NOT (identifier LIKE 'DEV%' AND team_name = 'Development') — AND, not OR.

## Gold layer schema

Gold naming: **PascalCase** — `DimDate`, `FactFreshdesk`, `FactLinear`. All created by `sql/09_gold_create_views.sql` (CREATE OR ALTER VIEW — safe to re-run).

**`gold.FactFreshdesk`** — view over silver.freshdesk_tickets

| Column | Notes |
|---|---|
| `id`, `status` | From silver |
| `status_label` | 'Open', 'Pending', 'Resolved', 'Closed', 'Waiting for triage', 'Passed triage', 'Other (NN)' |
| `triage_status` | 'Denied' / 'Waiting' / 'Passed' / 'Other' — main slicer for triage workflow |
| `created_at`, `updated_at`, `product_id` | From silver |
| `first_waiting_at`, `first_passed_at` | Period-based reporting dates |
| `denied_triage`, `denied_triage_at` | Regression flag and date |

**`gold.FactLinear`** — view over silver.linear_issues

| Column | Notes |
|---|---|
| `id`, `state_name`, `state_type` | From silver |
| `state_label` | 'Backlog / Unstarted', 'In Progress', 'Completed', 'Cancelled', 'Other' — collapses backlog+unstarted |
| `priority`, `priority_label` | 0=No priority … 4=Low (matches Linear's own labels) |
| `created_at`, `started_at`, `completed_at`, `closed_at` | From silver |
| `days_to_start` | DATEDIFF(DAY, created_at, started_at) |
| `days_to_close` | DATEDIFF(DAY, created_at, closed_at) |
| `age_days` | For open issues only — days since created_at, NULL when closed |
| `project_name`, `assignee_name`, `labels`, `trashed`, `is_incident` | From silver |

**Power BI relationships (DATE-to-DATE):**
- `DimDate.date_key` → `FactFreshdesk.created_at` (primary)
- `DimDate.date_key` → `FactFreshdesk.first_waiting_at` (role-playing)
- `DimDate.date_key` → `FactFreshdesk.first_passed_at` (role-playing)
- `DimDate.date_key` → `FactLinear.created_at` (primary)
- `DimDate.date_key` → `FactLinear.closed_at` (role-playing)

## Morning refresh (manual, local — interim until automation is done)

```powershell
git pull
python script/bronze_loader.py
sqlcmd -S INTSQLSERVER01 -d InternalStatistics -U dittanvändarnamn -P dittlösenord -i "sql\05_silver_load_freshdesk.sql"
sqlcmd -S INTSQLSERVER01 -d InternalStatistics -U dittanvändarnamn -P dittlösenord -i "sql\07_silver_load_linear.sql"
```

This will be replaced by GitHub Actions automation (see Track 2 above). No `morning_refresh.ps1` will be built — automation goes through GitHub Actions instead.

## Power BI connection point

Power BI connects to the **gold layer only** — never silver or bronze directly.
Silver rebuilds (TRUNCATE + full reload) are not time-critical; Power BI does not
run live queries against silver, so the seconds-long truncation window is not a problem.

---

## Planned automation (next session)

- `script/silver_loader.py` — Python script (pyodbc, same pattern as bronze_loader.py) to run silver SQL scripts without sqlcmd
- Extend `.github/workflows/nightly-snapshots.yml` to also run bronze + silver after a successful snapshot commit — OR use SQL Server Agent / a self-hosted runner if the hosted runner can't reach `INTSQLSERVER01`
- Investigate whether `INTSQLSERVER01` is reachable from GitHub-hosted runners (it almost certainly isn't — need a self-hosted runner or SQL Server Agent)
- SSIS / SQL Server Agent when moved to a fully managed production setup

---

## Security constraints

- `credentials/` is git-ignored — never commit API keys or connection strings
- API keys: `FRESHDESK_API_KEY`, `LINEAR_API_KEY` (env vars or `credentials/*.txt`)
- SQL connection string: `SQL_CONNECTION_STRING` env var or `credentials/sql_connection.txt`
- GitHub Secrets configured: `LINEAR_API_KEY`, `FRESHDESK_API_KEY`
